            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="col">
                <p>Hi! My name is Madison, but you can call me Madi or M. <br><br>
                From a young age, I was fascinated by how things work—taking apart gadgets, tinkering with computers, 
                and eventually writing my first lines of code in high school. What started as curiosity quickly turned 
                into a passion, leading me to pursue a degree in computer science.<br><br>
                College was a time of deep exploration: algorithms, databases, web development, and endless hours of 
                debugging taught me not just the technical side of engineering, but also patience and persistence. 
                During this time, internships and side projects gave me hands-on experience building real-world 
                applications and collaborating with others.<br><br>
                After graduating, I began my career as a junior developer, contributing to everything from internal 
                tools to client-facing platforms. Over time, I took on more responsibility—leading small teams, 
                architecting systems, and mentoring newer engineers. Each role taught me something new, whether it was 
                how to write cleaner code, work cross-functionally, or build more user-focused products.<br><br>
                Today, I continue to grow as a software engineer, always staying curious and open to what’s next. 
                Whether I’m solving a complex technical challenge or helping a teammate succeed, I strive to build 
                software that makes a positive impact.</p>
